# Shop Mockup

I decided to create a quick e-commerce mockup in React for Lancashire's finest football club, Morecambe FC.

The main purpose of this was to explore the world of e-commerce solutions, and just have a better idea of the workflow that drives online shops, inspired by the developer roles at EKM. Not all features are properly padded out, such as the discount code feature, but I was mainly trying to explore the general logic behind creating baskets and product lists and state management in React.
